Tbh I was pretty sleep deprived so my experience is colored by that. <br/><br/>My main gripe is that I would have liked this book much better as a three+ part series. It crammed such an ambitious story into a relatively small novel. So many characters, overlapping backstories, magical systems , etc. I left the book feeling like most of the ideas were half baked. Because of this I didnâ€™t feel much emotion while reading it. My feelings of sadness or excitement were muted, a fraction of what they would have been if the story and characters were fleshed out",,,2,0

A collection of essays from a millennial freelance blog writer in various witty formats, with stories of a friends sisters funeral right next to a hungover breakfast recipe. Funny anecdotes from wild nights out, shitty boyfriends, going to therapy, and platonic friendships. <br/><br/>The book was well-written, and I appreciated the focus on the love you find in platonic friendships. There were times that I laughed and cried, and times where I was driven to introspect about my own relationships between partners and friends. However, I feel like this book just joined the ever growing hum of banal self-help advice offered to me by millennials through Tumblr, Youtube, or printed media since I was a teenager. I think had I read this in high school, I would've taken the authors advice as gospel, as she has an enviable air of self-assuredness to her tone of writing. However, at this point in life I can accept that her life experiences are so wildly different from my own. And while I can appreciate the stories she shared and use it to drive my own inner feelings about love and friendship, I shouldn't take any of the advice or lessons too seriously.<br/><br/>Overall - good book, just felt very unoriginal and redundant to many, many pieces of media I've seen/read in the past. This is by no fault of the author, I think Alderton did a great job of telling her stories and reflecting on how they affected her. However, I think I'm just nearing my limit of how many times I can hear a millennial write about how excessive partying in college was not fulfilling and and how therapy helped them feel better etc. However I do think their is value in reflecting in these mundane, unoriginal experiences and romanticizing them to find love in all the places it exists.",,,1,0

The revulsion that comes with the deep understanding of what it means to eat meat - and the question of how any member of any society can be seen as normal when participating in such an act. I want to be like Yeong-hye and scream at the top of my lungs anytime anyone dares to bring meat anywhere near me, but alas.<br/><br/>The other main theme in this book that stuck out to me was patriarchy. Yeong-hye's husband is a total bitch, a complete disgrace of a human being, but also a figure so common in patriarchal societies that he's sickeningly mundane. The father is not far off, but his patriarchal violence is physical as well as emotional.

I don't think that means that it makes the book wrong or unhelpful, but it was important for me to approach parts of this book with an open mind, but also accept that many things presented will not be relevant to me or those in my circles.<br/><br/>I do think this book is aimed more towards women than men, but I think that people of any gender can take away a host of things from this book.

I've followed the Green brothers and their various initiatives, projects, and ramblings for nearly half my life. However, I've never enjoyed John Green's novels much. That's not for lack of trying - I've read The Fault in Our Stars, Paper Towns, and Looking for Alaska. However, this book is different. <br/><br/>Many parts are not relatable to me. I would give other ratings and have different opinions and experiences about nearly everything mentioned in the book. It feels frustrating and wrong when you search for your favorite or least favorite restaurant on Yelp and don't see people agreeing with your opinion. However, with this book, the diverging opinions of the authors and me were not an issue. Beyond everything else, Green's writing conveys how much he cares about this Earth, this life, and everything about it. It's profoundly moving, and sometimes it feels like I'm reading scripture. Not because this book contains any holy divinations but because it views the world through a wondrous lens that I have often only heard when reading religious accounts of the Earth's creation.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with the voice of John Green through either his YouTube videos or his other novels - this is a book you can put down and pick up at any point. Each chapter is a mini essay (or Vlogbrothers video) that is self-contained and often has its own characters, arc, and moral. Usually, I'm not too fond of this format, but I enjoyed it this time. I was encouraged to read on not by cliffhangers and plot devices but by the chance to learn something new or hear a known topic discussed by someone whose opinion I have learned to respect.<br/><br/>I give The Anthropocene Reviewed five stars.",,,1,0

I enjoyed the nuance of the characters it really felt like the novel uncovered hidden dimensions of almost all the main characters involved.<br/><br/>However, the book lost me a bit in the second half. I became less interested in the mother-daughter dynamic as the novel wore on. I think this is because a lot of content and feelings were repeated, and live events were told twiceâ€”although with different perspectives each time.

I liked the premise and how each chapter contained a separate story. However, I found pretty much all of the stories to be pretty conservative and patriarchal - which was disappointing.<br/><br/>1st story: The narrator is the most beautiful woman alive but doesn't notice because she's so focused on her career. However, she starts dating a shy, self-conscious nerd. Once he breaks up with her on the same day he's leaving for America - she is desperate to get him back. She travels back in time to beg him not to go. This story reeked of tired old romance tropes. It reduced the main character to a desperate girl patiently waiting 3 years for a mediocre man to return from America.<br/><br/>2nd story: A woman's husband gets dementia. She explains that he never got her gifts or even wrote a love letter to her throughout her marriage. She travels back in time, hoping he might write her something showing he loves her. And once he no longer remembers her, she still remains as his caretaker until he dies. Her expectation as a wife is to accept whatever scraps of affection her husband offers to show her and to stay his nurse and caretaker throughout it all.<br/><br/>3rd story: A woman leaves behind her family and their rigid expectations of her to become a bartender. When her sister dies, her parents don't even talk to her because they blame her for the death and resent her for choosing a different path in life than the one they had laid out. However, when she goes back in time to visit her now-dead sister, she decides she must be the proper daughter her parents want her to be to make amends. She moves back home, forsaking her own dream. Her expectation as a daughter and sister is to live out her life in service of a dead sister and parents who only acknowledge her when she is following their rules.<br/><br/>4th story: An ill woman decides to have a pregnancy despite knowing that it will kill her. This is framed as a highly selfless act to an unborn child instead of the unnecessary loss of life that it is. Mind you, this book is set in modern days, where there is absolutely no excuse for a mother to die for their unborn child. It is so much better to live for those who you love (including potential future children) than sacrifice yourself for an unborn child.<br/><br/>Each of these stories perpetuates gendered, conservative stereotypes about family and relationships. While each story has tender, wholesome moments that show genuine love and character growth, I found this book disappointing overall. It squandered so much potential for 4 stories that feel like they would have been mainstream narratives in the 1800s.",,,1,0

While I enjoyed it, it often felt like it was written for high schoolers. I think if I were to read this when I was back in grade school, I would have enjoyed it much more than I did reading it today.<br/><br/>I liked reading about Tran's punk coming-of-age and the antics and identity he used to define himself throughout his adolescence. I enjoyed reading about his love for reading and literature and how it made him feel less alone to read the mistakes, hopes, and fears of authors of the past, a sentiment I resonate with. I thought Tran was a likable protagonist, although I did not always feel he was entirely honest in the picture he painted of himself as a youth. His narration feels too rose-colored - I would have enjoyed a more nuanced picture of him not always doing the right thing and coming up short while he figured himself out.<br/><br/>A reoccurring pattern in this book was that Tran would give a potent anecdote from his life, then add some introspection but stop short of how deep I wished his introspection would go. The times where he does go deeper, for example, addressing the racism and misogyny within his own group of friends, I enjoyed it and wish it happened more often. Perhaps it's on me as the reader to discern these deeper meanings and read between the lines to understand how the different experiences of Trans life and identity affected one another. It would be a natural exercise for me if I were reading fiction, but in a memoir, I don't want to project those assumptions onto the lived experiences of a real person. Part of my disappointment came from Tran himself talking about the intricacies of the literature and philosophy that inspired him, and I expected more from him after reading about how the things he read and wrote in high school. I can only hope Tran will eventually write another book where he delves into his life post-high school with more introspection and depth for a more mature audience. <br/>",,,1,0

I never read this in middle/high school like most people had, but it's been on my list to read as an adult for a while.<br/><br/>The book deals a lot with the doubts, fears, and angst of growing up, especially as a teenage boy. I recognized a lot of my teenage self in Holden. Still, as a whole, I found I simply didn't want to read the ramblings of a character so hypocritical, pessimistic, and annoying. Like many other 'American classic' novels, I found most of the value of reading this book in being a part of the conversation around it. People have been dissecting and analyzing every part of this book for decades, and its status as a literary legend means that there's lots of thoughtful discourse to engage in that is more interesting than the book itself.<br/><br/>I thought the book would hit harder since I've also been thinking a lot recently about growing up and feeling directionless (and I live in New York City). Tbh, I think the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is just as worthwhile to read if you're looking for some hypocritical teenage angst from an insecure narrator - although slightly more sociopathic.",,,1,0

The author's storytelling is gripping in a way that makes me utterly unsurprised that it was a bestseller for so long. I found this story incredibly inspirational, as the author challenges all of the assumptions she grew up with, shakes off the fears and worries of her upbringing, and goes forth into the world with so much passion and sees enormous success and happiness. I also found myself incredibly frustrated at times with the author, as it takes her years to leave, what is clear to the reader and the author in hindsight, an extreme cycle of abuse with her family. However, I left the book with a sense of optimism and an insane amount of respect and empathy for Tara Westover.<br/><br/>This book has been on my radar for years. Many of my friends know I'm ex-mormon, and a lot of them mentioned this book to me throughout the years. The author starts the book with a disclaimer that this book is not a criticism of Mormonism and is not relatable to the average Mormon experience. Still, I didn't find that entirely true. While it's true that every Mormon approaches the religion differently, I recognized many feelings and sentiments of the author's parents that rang true to what I experienced with my parents and other adults in the church, although usually to a lesser degree. Growing up with people whose entire livelihoods, moral framework, and life views are dictated by the Mormon church and subject to change at any time due to ""personal revelation"" is a reality to millions of people in the United States. After telling my parents I had left the church after going off to college, I once awoke to my mother standing over me, telling me she had a personal revelation from God that I was mentally poisoning my younger siblings, telling them to leave the church as I had. <br/><br/>Westover also spoke to a feeling I hadn't ever put into words: a deep melancholy at leaving the Mormon community. Of occasionally returning to a place and to people you know you had outgrown. Maybe it just hit especially hard because I read it during the holidays when I was visiting my still Mormon parents, having the same religious and moral discussions we've had a dozen times since I left the church.<br/><br/>This book was also the kick I needed to finally get documents notarized to formalize leaving the Mormon church, so thank you for that, Ms. Westover.",,,1,0

I picked it up based on a Goodreads review and listened to the audiobook throughout two nights. It touched upon many feelings on my mind over the past few months. It gave me a lot to think about along the themes of:<br/> - The inherent power dynamic that occurs in relationships between men and women.<br/> - The role physical intimacy plays in relationships and how the emotional relationship dynamics are tied to the physical ones.<br/> - What you owe to other people. From what you owe to a sexual partner to what you owe to a romantic partner to what you owe to friends, families, and strangers.<br/><br/>I found the descriptions of Connell's loneliness and depression, the feelings that he isn't good enough, and his shame in his past mistakes incredibly moving and relatable. It made me feel like I wasn't alone. This character exploration was the high point to me in the book and has affected how I contextualize my thoughts around these themes in my personal life. I do wish this had been more of a focus, however. I feel like the novel doesn't address his depression treatment much beyond explaining that he started medication.<br/><br/>I also think that the way this book fetishizes abuse and revels in the possibility of Connell abusing Marianne is gross and overdone. Connell consistently treats Marianne like shit throughout the book, and I feel like the book is encouraging us to see him as changed after high school, when in reality, he's only acting slightly less bad than he was in high school. This made me less interested in reading the book, but I always have a hard time caring about the main characters that I think are bad people. However, the book did make Connell a complex enough character for me to stay attentive.<br/> ",,,1,0
